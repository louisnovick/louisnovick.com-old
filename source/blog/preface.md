##Preface

Because this is my first post on this site I thought I would start by saying hello!

The goal for these posts is simple, to reflect on what I learn and to impart knowledge on anybody who will listen.  I'm in no way close to being an _"expert"_ in the field of web development but I am becoming more confident in my own abilities day by day and am confident that I'll at least feel like an _"expert"_ eventually.  By sharing what I learn while leveling up my skills I hope to become a larger part of the amazing community of developers that inspire my work each and every day.  I certainly feel like I am walking in the footsteps of giants. Humbling, scary and exciting all at the same time.

Thank you for taking the time to explore what I've learned and if you have any requests for what I should write about, please reach out to me and I will do my best to deliver.
