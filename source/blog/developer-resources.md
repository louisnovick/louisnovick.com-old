## Practice Makes the Master

As a Web Developer I make it a point to try and learn something new about my craft each and everyday.  I do this for a few reasons but let me start by stating something obvious.  If your knowledge of a particular subject, in this case web development, increases by 1% everyday than by the end of the year you will have become 365% better at web development.  I try to look at this daily “knowledge seeking” as a sort of compounding investment that continues to grow with each passing year.  This is part of the reason why I am confident I will become an expert someday.  

As a side note I would like to say that it’s of utter importance to love what you do.  If you don’t then how will you motivate yourself to keep exploring the many facets of your craft?  How can you keep yourself traveling down a path with no destination in mind?  If you don’t love what you do you’re wasting your time and I beg you to reconsider the path you’ve you set yourself on.  I don’t think its ever too late to change course.  

I have compiled a list of resources I use in my spare time to keep up with my daily learning and level up my skills.  While varying in medium, they all fulfill their purpose in my professional life.  Here they are:

###[Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/)

The Shop Talk Show is a radio show hosted by Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier, two savants in the industry of web design & development.  During the show they discuss web trends, new technologies and pretty much anything internet related.  One of the shows aspects that set it apart in my mind is that they interview other professionals in the industry and perform a Q&A when the allotted time presents itself.  I can’t tell you how many times a listener of the show will pose a question I had already been pondering for some time.  It goes without saying that I often find myself edified at the end of every episode.  The best part about shoptalkshow is that it comes in the form of an easily accessible podcast.  I often listen to new episodes on the way to work without any interruption to my day which is always a good thing.   

###[Codepen](http://codepen.io/)

Every visit to Codepen feels fresh and rewarding.  Users of the web app can experiment in a “sandbox” with css, html, js and other variations of these languages.  I often use it simply to see what other people are messing with.  You would be surprised at some of the things users create just for fun.  Sometimes if I feel like messing around I’ll just create a new pen and plug away.  I find Codepen a tool of great inspiration and would recommend you check it out if you haven’t already.  

###[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

You have probably heard of CSS-tricks.  Searching for anything css related on google will generally return a Css tricks article or snippet on the first page and why not, they’re awesome.  I have rarely had a styling problem left unsolved after using this wonderful resource.  They also have a lovely snippet library that I haven’t used much but I am sure would be enlightening if you were just starting out.  Css Tricks also boast an active community that is always eager to critique your work and help you with any issues you may have.  If you’ve never been to Css tricks, definitely check it out.  

###[Tympanus Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/)

As a Designer/Developer you know all about creativity blocks.  Similar to “Writers Block”, it’s a moment experienced by many where you simply aren’t being creative anymore.  You start doing what just works and forget to innovate or try new things.  This is potentially harmful to you because if you become complacent with the quality of your work you may find it hard to improve.  Tympanus Codrops is an excellent resource that gives you tons of free resources, demos and tutorials to checkout.  I find it a source of inspiration and it often helps me get past any creativity blocks I may be experiencing.    

###Final Words

It goes without saying that there are countless free resources online you can use for inspiration, as tools and as learning companions.  It's not really important which ones you choose to use, only that you use them.  By practicing your skills and diving further into the complexity of your trade, you can continue to level up without burning yourself out.  Keeping your mind challenged with fresh material is important in this regard.  So what are you waiting for? Get out there and learn.
