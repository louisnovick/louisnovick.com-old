##An introduction

Since this is the first post on my site I thought I would start by saying hey!  I plan on using this blog to reflect on what I learn on the subject of Front-End Web Development and share with you my thoughts and feelings on similar topics.  By sharing what I learn while leveling up my skills I hope to become a larger part of the amazing community of developers that continue to inspire my work each and every day.  I certainly feel like I am walking in the footsteps of giants. This is all together humbling, scary and exciting.

If you have any requests for what I should write about, please reach out to me and I will do my best to deliver.
