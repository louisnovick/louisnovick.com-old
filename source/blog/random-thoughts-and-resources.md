##Practice makes the Master

First you choose something you love to do.  For me this is web development.  Then you make the conscious decision to keep getting better at it until you feel you've mastered it, which is probably never.  Practice, practice, practice and relish in the Journey.

I make it a point to try and practice every day.  I'll usually work on my website, analyze how something else is built, try out a new tool/method or just throw some code on the canvas.  If your ability to perform a particular skill increases by 1% everyday than by the end of the year you will have become at the very least, 365% better at it.  I try to look at this daily experience as a sort of compounding investment that continues to grow with each passing year.  One day I'm going to look back and smile.

##Resources I use (Last Updated July 20th, 2015)
I have compiled a list of resources I use to keep up with my learning and to practice/level up my skills.  While varying in medium, they all fulfill their purpose in my professional life and help me get better at what I love.  Here they are:
