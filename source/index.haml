.aboutme
	%h3 Web Development is my passion. 
	%h5 I also love Coffee, Gaming and Traveling.
	%p 
		The knowledge that with the proper tools and vision I can build whatever I want fills me with a burning desire to keep learning and leveling up my skills.  I have been working as a Front End Developer for over a year now and have continued to improve upon my talents since my first line of HTML code over 2 years ago.  
		<br /><br />
		Two things that really interest me are data manipulation and User Experience Design.  There's a gold mine of knowledge on the web just waiting to be curated and presented in a way that interests users.  I can only hope that through improving my skills in both these fields I can create beautiful data visualizations that not only interest users, but present them with information they can both understand and find useful.  
		<br /><br />
		I am always looking for new ways to occupy my time, utilize my skills and learn so if you're looking for an extra hand on any of your projects, <a href="#contact" title="contactme">lets talk</a>.
