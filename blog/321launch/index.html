My goal for this blog is to reflect on what I learn and to impart knowledge on anybody who will listen. I am by no means an expert but I know for certain that I have the potential to be one someday. To build this site I utilized Middleman and Bourbon in conjunction with other modern web technologies. Developing this site really exposed me to some things I feel I have really been missing out on. Some of these include:</p> <ul> <li>Haml and static site templating</li> <li>SCSS Partials and inline Media Queries</li> <li>SVG</li> </ul> <h3>Haml and Static Site Templating</h3> <p>Prior to developing this site I had never used HAML. I had dabbled in ERB a few months ago when I was getting my hands dirty with Ruby on Rails but had never really explored it in earnest. Honestly, the only other real HTML templating I had really been exposed to was Jade but my knowledge of it was limited. I wont say that any one of them is the &ldquo;best&rdquo; because I truly believe that it depends entirely on your own preference. Due to my lack of prior experience in HTML templating I had a clean slate if you will. Lets just say that learning Haml has ruined me for Vanilla HTML forever. The simple fact that this <code>.row</code> in Haml is equal to this <code>&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> saves you a ton of time when dealing with long templates. Obviously, this doesn&rsquo;t even scratch the surface of what you can do with <a href="//http//haml.info/">Haml</a>.</p> <h3>SCSS Partials and Inline Media Queries</h3> <p>I had used SCSS prior to developing this site but I suppose some of its&rsquo; better features never really crossed my mind until now. For one thing, when I first started developing websites I fell into the trap of extremely bloated and hard to maintain CSS. I think that this is to be expected of someone just getting their feet wet but I do wish I had started using SCSS in all of it&rsquo;s glory earlier on in my career. For one thing, the ability to partial out your styles into little manageable slices is invaluable to me. No more ctrl F&#39;ing through a file to find that one pesky selecter I want removed. I simply go to the partial responsible and deal with the issue, efficiently. Using inline media queries also aided me during development because I didn&rsquo;t have to keep track of where I put all of my blasted media queries. By leveraging the <a href="//bourbon.io/">Bourban</a> Sass Framework I was able to use something like <code>@include media(min-width 769px)</code> right on the selector in question to achieve whatever it I was hoping to achieve. SCSS is wonderful tool and I hope to become more proficent with it as I continue to use it my work.</p> <h3>SVG</h3> <p>SVG is an interesting facet of the modern web that I was eager to explore. I tried incorporating some SVG logos onto my site in an effort to keep them looking good at any size. I also experimented with some SVG animation but it didn&rsquo;t really work out for me. The SVGs did animate but I simply couldn&rsquo;t justify having them move around for no apparent reason. From a UX standpoint, I found them distracting and from a development standpoint they simply weren&rsquo;t efficient so I did away with the animation. I did however keep the SVGs around which do look great, especially on my retina display.</p> <h3>Final Remarks</h3> <p>If you havn&rsquo;t developed a website for yourself yet or are currently striving to redesign your current site as I did you should consider diving into <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. Similar to Jekyll, Middleman is a static site generator that leverages Ruby to create an excellent development environment for you to work in, as well as make it easy to deploy/manage the site later down the road. I currently work on this site locally and when I am ready to push it out to github pages, I simply type in <code>middleman deploy</code> and off it goes. It truly is a great way to develop websites that feels fresh and efficient. If you have any questions for me please don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in contact with me and once again, welcome to my site.</p> <hr> </section> <footer class=footer role=contentinfo> <div class=footer-secondary-links> &copy; Louis Novick 2015 <ul class=footer-social> <li class=nav-link> <a href='//www.twitter.com/louisnovick' target=_blank> <img alt=Twitter src='../../images/thumbs/twitter-9917a027.svg'> </a> </li> <li class=nav-link> <a href='//www.github.com/louisnovick' target=_blank> <img alt=Github src='../../images/thumbs/github-589a10f1.svg'> </a> </li> <li class=nav-link> <a href='//www.dribbble.com/louisnovick' target=_blank> <img alt=Dribbble src='../../images/thumbs/dribbble-c9dad5a2.svg'> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </footer> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.slick/1.4.1/slick.min.js"></script> <script src="../../javascripts/all-6b956423.js"></script> <script>
